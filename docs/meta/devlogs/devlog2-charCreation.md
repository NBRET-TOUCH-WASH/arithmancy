&nbsp;

Hey again, it's been a while since the last devlog, eh?

While there were major additions to the game, there paradoxically isn't much to say that's not made to be said by the game's documentation.

The new content relates to __character creation__. You can now select a fantasy race, a character class and tweak your character's attributes.

It was planned to be able to either get a random name based on the player's selected race or manually type it in. It was also planned to be bale to either select a gender from a set of preemptively added ones or manually type it in if needed. For these two features, only the former part was implemented. I had an incredibly hard time trying to even figure out how text input worked in `tcod`, the game's main library. In the end, for the sake of the project's progress, a random name is issued to player (still based on the selected race), and the gender feature was completely scrapped.

Anyway, on "better" news, the project's planning might get a little funky from now on...

The project was put aside in favor of upcoming exams by the "executive team", this was originally a school project that would (once done with the production phase and past the project's deadline) become a personal project of mine.

However, as it was put aside, I now have less motivation to work on the game, especially since I really am not enjoying working in Python. Making the game itself is fun, even with all the bugs and everything, but Python and its dynamic typing, syntax and everyting kind of annoy me. My organization can also be blamed for this project's progress getting sluggish, as this project's structure is __a mess__, to say the least.

In short, this project will either directly skip to the post-mortem phase and get redone in C#, be put on hiatus for an undetermined amount of time and from the latter, either be abandoned in favor of the creation of a new game or be rehandled at some point in the future, still in Python for a final version.
