---

Hello everyone that will (hopefully) play *Arithmancy*!

In this first devlog, there won't be much concrete changes to discuss, as this mostly is the beginning of the project and consists mainly of paving the way for the main gameplay which will come at a later date.

&nbsp;

### __[ADDITION] ; [FEATURE]__ | Main menu

The game now has a main menu (pictured above)!

It is the first screen you're expected to see when launching the game. From there you can either start the game, learn more about it, customize it to your liking or simply exit the program.

It was heavily inspired by that of [*Dwarf Fortress*](https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) (pictured above), a game I not only really enjoy, but who also served as a major source of inspiration for *Arithmancy*'s features in quite an obvious way.

In a more surprising way, it was also inspired by many main menus for RPG Maker games such as *Yume Nikki*.

&nbsp;

As of writing the *"About"* section has nothing, for each of these NSI projects, it has been something I write at the end, summarizing everything from the development experience.

Also, there are no options right now and just a silly message instead, but they are planned to be implemented at some point, so hang on tight!

&nbsp;

Anyway, there isn't much more to say, the next step is __character creation__, where there will be way more to discuss with all the different boons and characteristics that should be available!
