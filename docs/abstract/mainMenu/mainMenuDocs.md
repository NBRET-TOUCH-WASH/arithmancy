Upon execution, players will be greeted by the game's main menu; featuring an __ASCII-art header__, __a series of options__ to choose from, __licensing information__ at the bottom left and a __version tag__ at the bottom right.

&nbsp;

#### ASCII-art header
Self-explanatory.

&nbsp;

#### Options
The - admittedly - most interesting part of the menu, these options offer the player to either __start a game__ (*"Beget"*) [*Cf.* [*§Character creation*](#character-creation)], __learn more about the game itself__ and its licensing (*"About"*), ~~__customize__ their user experience~~ display a marvelous poem (*"Options"*), and __quit__ the program (*"Forfare"*).

&nbsp;

#### Licensing information
Licensing information about the game, which is licensed under the *Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0)* [*Cf*. [*§Licensing*](#licensing)].

&nbsp;

#### ~~Customize user experience~~
__[REDACTED]__

&nbsp;

#### Version tag
Simply displays the executable's version, including both tag (e.g. `v.0.1.0`) and codename (e.g. *"Backwards"*), in order to help users easily distinguish each version ~~(along with just being cool)~~.
