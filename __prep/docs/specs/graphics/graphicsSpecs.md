## Global specifications

This section focuses on graphics settings that apply to every aspect of the game.

### Resolution

- Resolution (*COLUMNS*x*LINES*): `115x65`
    - Width (*COLUMNS*) : `115`
    - height (*LINES*): `65`

## Main menu

The main menu for the game, which will greet player upon execution:

![mainMenu](/__prep/docs/assets/graphics/mainMenu.png)

This appearance was essentially inspired by two games:

- *Dwarf Fortress*' main menu:

![dwarfFortressMainMenu](/__prep/docs/assets/graphics/dwarfFortressMainMenu.png)

- *Yume Nikki*'s main menu (and basically a lot of other *RPG Maker* games):

![yumeNikkiMainMenu](/__prep/docs/assets/graphics/YumeNikkiMainMenu.jpg)

## Main game

During the main part of the game, the UI should look something like this:

![main game sketch](/__prep/docs/assets/graphics/mainGame.png)

This screen layout is inspired by several games:

- *Dwarf Fortress*' __Adventure[r] mode__ main screen:

![dwarFortressMainGame](/__prep/docs/assets/graphics/dwarfFortressMainGame.png)

- *Angband*'s main screen:

![angbandMainGame](/__prep/docs/assets/graphics/angbandMainGame.png)

![gameOver](/__prep/docs/assets/graphics/gameOver.png)

Layout inspired by:

- *Angband*'s Game Over screen/menu:

![angbandGameOver](/__prep/docs/assets/graphics/angbandGameOver.png)

- *Shadowgate*'s Game Over sequence:
