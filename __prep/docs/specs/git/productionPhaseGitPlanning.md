## Postamble

The production phase for *Arithmancy* should last for __30 days__ of the game's __â‰ˆ47 days (1 month and 17 days)__ of allowed development (basically ranging from the __1st of November 2022__ (`2022-10-15`) to the __30th of November 2022__ (`2022-10-31`) ) until the project's deadline (near the end of November).

From this will arise version `v1.0.0`, after which the game will quite possibly enter its __post-mortem phase__ - i.e. additional development independant of the original project - without any hiccups.
