An issue in *mermaid-js*' GitGraph rendering makes the completion of the production phase Git graph impossible at the time of writing. As such, it is currently incomplete as well as being buggy is left "as is".

## Postamble

The production phase for *Arithmancy* should last for __30 days__ of the game's __â‰ˆ47 days (1 month and 17 days)__ of allowed development (basically ranging from the __1st of November 2022__ (`2022-11-01`) to the __30th of November 2022__ (`2022-11-30`) ) reaching the project's deadline.

From this will arise version `v1.0.0`, after which the game will quite possibly enter its __post-mortem phase__ - i.e. additional development independant of the original project - without any hiccups.
