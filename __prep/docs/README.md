## Info

*Arithmancy* is an RPG game made as part of the NSI [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)-based __RPG game project__.

The game features ASCII graphics, akin to that of [*Rogue*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)), [*Angband*](https://rephial.org/) or [*Dwarf Fortress*](https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/screens.html). As the project's base implies, it uses **O**bject-**O**riented **P**rogramming as its coding paradigm - implemented in the [Python programming language](https://python.org).

## Documentation

This repository contains **EVERYTHING** about the game, even files unnecessary to the player's experience, such as all the [preparatory phase stuff](/__prep/), practicing to code with the game's main library... In order to simply play the game and not worry about downloading "useless" data, a `.zip` file will be provided with every release only containing the game code.

Of course, feel free to download the entire source code to take a look at the planning of the game itself.

## Development

*Arithmancy*'s development will first span from mid-October 2022 to the end of November 2022. During this time, the game will progressively be fleshed out, with more features, gameplay elements and progression as time goes on.

Said development's planning can be checked out in the three main phases' respective __Git planning files__:

- [Preparatory phase Git planning document](/__prep/docs/gitgraph/preparatoryPhaseGitPlanning.md)
- [Production phase Git planning document]()
- [Post-mortem phase Git planning document]()

With each major "breakthrough" in the game's graphics, gampleplay or project development stage will come a separate release, all standardized by using a [*The Beginner's Guide* level](https://the-beginners-guide.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_levels) name as their internal codename.

### Features

As features are added to the game, they will be documented in this section, as well as within the [changelog file](CHANGELOG.md).
