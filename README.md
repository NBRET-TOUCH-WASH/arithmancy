## Devlogs

Along with each major development steps (mainly represented by each [successful pull request](https://github.com/NBRET-TOUCH-WASH/arithmancy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)) will come a corresponding devlog and set of documentation.

The first is both a way to document the changes made in a more explicit fashion than ye old [Changelog file](/CHANGELOG.md) along with documentation, it also is a way to remain motivated by sharing progress in the game's development towards a successful playable version (`v1.0.0`).

Devlogs can be accessed via [their assigned directory](/docs/meta/devlogs/), or the following list:

- [Devlog N°1](/docs/meta/devlogs/devlog1-mainMenu.md) - *"Beget"* | __Main menu__

## Gameplay

*Arithmancy*'s gameplay consists of controlling a character and moving about in a world divided in __tiles__. It also features semi-turn-based __combat__ and a wide array of miscellaneous activities.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Main menu

![main menu v0.1.0](/docs/assets/gameplay/main_menu/main_menu_cropped.png)

Upon execution, players will be greeted by the game's main menu; featuring an __ASCII-art header__, __a series of options__ to choose from, __licensing information__ at the bottom left and a __version tag__ at the bottom right.

&nbsp;

#### ASCII-art header
Self-explanatory.

&nbsp;

#### Options
The - admittedly - most interesting part of the menu, these options offer the player to either __start a game__ (*"Beget"*) [*Cf.* [*§Character creation*](#character-creation)], __learn more about the game itself__ and its licensing (*"About"*), ~~__customize__ their user experience~~ display a marvelous poem (*"Options"*), and __quit__ the program (*"Forfare"*).

&nbsp;

#### Licensing information
Licensing information about the game, which is licensed under the *Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0)* [*Cf*. [*§Licensing*](#licensing)].

&nbsp;

#### ~~Customize user experience~~
__[REDACTED]__

&nbsp;

#### Version tag
Simply displays the executable's version, including both tag (e.g. `v.0.1.0`) and codename (e.g. *"Backwards"*), in order to help users easily distinguish each version ~~(along with just being cool)~~.
