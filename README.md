## Devlogs

Along with each major development steps (mainly represented by each [successful pull request](https://github.com/NBRET-TOUCH-WASH/arithmancy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)) will come a corresponding devlog and set of documentation.

The first is both a way to document the changes made in a more explicit fashion than ye old [Changelog file](/CHANGELOG.md) along with documentation, it also is a way to remain motivated by sharing progress in the game's development towards a successful playable version (`v1.0.0`).

Devlogs can be accessed via [their assigned directory](/docs/meta/devlogs/), or the following list:

- [Devlog N°1](/docs/meta/devlogs/devlog1-mainMenu.md) - *"Beget"* | __Main menu__
- [Devlog N°2](/docs/meta/devlogs/devlog2-charCreation.md) - *"New OC — do not steal."* | __Character creation__

---

## Gameplay

*Arithmancy*'s gameplay consists of controlling a character and moving about in a world divided in __tiles__. It also features semi-turn-based __combat__ and a wide array of miscellaneous activities.
